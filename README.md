Python 3.x     
Flask      
pandas    
joblib      
scikit-learn 

**File Structure**    
app.py – Main Flask app and prediction logic  
flood_dataset.csv – Dataset used for model training  
model_k.pkl – Pre-trained machine learning model (not provided here)  
templates/ – Folder containing HTML templates for the web interface
